## Project Objective : Create A Dashboard
Create a dashboard to show the transcations made for a certain store in 3 regions. Determine which region made the most sales, which product was sold the most, Sales of all the Sales Representatives and show the trend of the sales of the store from the the year 2014 to 2015.

## Data Sourcing.
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from this link https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/P12-TransactionalData.csv. The data had 9 columns and 44 rows.
----
## Data Transformation.
No transformations were done to the data because it was clean.

## Findings and Recommendations.
I created several pivot tables for the Visualisations in relation to the Sales Reps, Regions, Items and Date. This made analysis of the sales transactions to be easily understood and the summary is as follows below:
- Region 1 made the most sales in the two years.
- Sales Rep with the most sales overally was Matthew who is from Region 1.
- The sales trend for all regions combined from the latest month has a downward trend although region 2 is the only region with rising sales in the latest months.
- The sale of Desks is increasing and Desks are mostly bought in only Regions 1 and 3.
- The sale of Pen sets is plummeting.
- The sale of Pencils is increasing.
> Recommendations:
1. Increase supply of pencils and desks in region 1.
2. Increase supply of Binders, Pens, Pen sets and pencils in region 2.
3. More investigation should be done in region 3 because the sale of all items is plummeting in the region
